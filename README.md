# Realm Bin BE

Backend for Realm Bin Pastebin Clone.

## Running on local

1. Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/irvanmalik48/arienne-elysia
```

2. Install dependencies:

You'll need to install `valkey` for the KV database. Do refer to their site on how to set it up.

I use `pnpm` for package management and advise you to do so as well. But this advice is more of an
optional errand rather than a mandatory one so use whatever package management you desire.

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Running dev server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
